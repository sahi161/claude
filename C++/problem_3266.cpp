Here's a complete, well-commented C++ solution for the LeetCode problem #3266 "Final Array State After K Multiplication Operations II":


class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> getFinalState(vector<int>& nums, int k, int multiplier) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int mod = 1e9 + 7;
        
        // Create a min-heap to efficiently find the minimum value
        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> pq;
        
        // Push all elements from nums into the min-heap
        for (int num : nums) {
            pq.push(num);
        }
        
        // Perform k operations
        while (k--) {
            // Find the minimum value in the min-heap
            int minVal = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            
            // Multiply the minimum value by the multiplier
            long long newVal = (long long)minVal * multiplier;
            
            // Apply modulo to the new value and push it back into the min-heap
            pq.push(newVal % mod);
        }
        
        // Apply modulo to every value in the min-heap and store in the result vector
        vector<int> result;
        while (!pq.empty()) {
            result.push_back(pq.top() % mod);
            pq.pop();
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};


Approach and Complexity Analysis:
1. We create a min-heap (priority queue) to efficiently find the minimum value in the array. The min-heap is implemented using a priority queue in C++.

2. We push all the elements from the input array `nums` into the min-heap. This allows us to retrieve the minimum value in O(1) time.

3. We perform `k` operations. In each operation:
   - We find the minimum value in the min-heap by accessing the top element of the priority queue. This takes O(1) time.
   - We multiply the minimum value by the `multiplier` and apply the modulo operation to keep the value within the range of a 32-bit integer.
   - We push the new value back into the min-heap. Pushing an element into a min-heap takes O(log n) time, where n is the size of the min-heap.

4. After performing all `k` operations, we apply the modulo operation to every value in the min-heap and store the results in a new vector.

5. Finally, we return the resulting vector containing the final state of the array after performing all operations and applying the modulo.

Time Complexity:
- Pushing all elements from `nums` into the min-heap takes O(n log n) time, where n is the size of `nums`.
- Performing `k` operations, where each operation involves finding the minimum value and pushing a new value into the min-heap, takes O(k log n) time.
- Applying the modulo operation to every value in the min-heap and storing the results in a new vector takes O(n) time.
- Overall, the time complexity is O((n + k) log n).

Space Complexity:
- The min-heap stores all the elements from `nums`, so it requires O(n) space.
- The resulting vector also requires O(n) space to store the final state of the array.
- Overall, the space complexity is O(n).
