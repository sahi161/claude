/*
Approach:
1. Check if the lengths of s and goal are equal. If not, return false.
2. If s and goal are equal, check if there are any duplicate characters in s. If there are, return true; otherwise, return false.
3. Find the indices where the characters in s and goal differ.
4. If there are exactly 2 differences and swapping the characters at those indices makes s equal to goal, return true; otherwise, return false.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input strings. We iterate through the strings once to find the differing indices.
Space Complexity: O(n) in the worst case, where all characters in s are unique and we store them in the unordered_set. In the case where s and goal are not equal, the space complexity is O(1) as we only store the differing indices.

Best Coding Practices:
- Use meaningful variable names
- Handle edge cases first (length check, equal strings check)
- Use appropriate data structures (unordered_set for checking duplicates, vector for storing indices)
- Provide comments explaining the approach and complexity analysis

Testing:
The code has been tested against the provided example cases and additional test cases to ensure correctness.
