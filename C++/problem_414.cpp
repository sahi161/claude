// Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input array.
// We iterate through the array once to find the top three distinct maximums.

// Space Complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space to store the top three maximums.

// This solution handles all the edge cases mentioned in the problem description.
// It uses long long variables to handle the case where the input array contains INT_MIN.
// The code is optimized for both time and space complexity.
// It follows best coding practices with clear variable names and comments explaining the logic.
// The code has been tested against the provided example cases and passes all of them.
