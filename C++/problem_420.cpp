Here's a complete, well-commented C++ solution for the Strong Password Checker problem:


class Solution {
public:
    int strongPasswordChecker(string password) {
        int n = password.length();
        bool hasLower = false, hasUpper = false, hasDigit = false;
        int requiredChars = 0, replaces = 0, oneReplace = 0, twoReplace = 0;
        
        // Check for missing character types and count repeating characters
        for (int i = 0; i < n;) {
            if (islower(password[i])) hasLower = true;
            if (isupper(password[i])) hasUpper = true;
            if (isdigit(password[i])) hasDigit = true;
            
            int j = i;
            while (i < n && password[i] == password[j]) i++;
            int repeats = i - j;
            
            if (repeats >= 3) {
                replaces += repeats / 3;
                if (repeats % 3 == 0) oneReplace++;
                if (repeats % 3 == 1) twoReplace++;
            }
        }
        
        requiredChars = (hasLower ? 0 : 1) + (hasUpper ? 0 : 1) + (hasDigit ? 0 : 1);
        
        if (n < 6) {
            // Password is too short
            return max(requiredChars, 6 - n);
        } else if (n <= 20) {
            // Password is within valid length range
            return max(requiredChars, replaces);
        } else {
            // Password is too long
            int deleteCount = n - 20;
            
            // Try to delete characters from repeating sequences
            replaces -= min(deleteCount, oneReplace);
            replaces -= min(max(deleteCount - oneReplace, 0), twoReplace * 2) / 2;
            replaces -= max(deleteCount - oneReplace - twoReplace * 2, 0) / 3;
            
            return deleteCount + max(requiredChars, replaces);
        }
    }
};


Approach and Complexity Analysis:
1. We first count the number of missing character types (lowercase, uppercase, digit) and store them in `requiredChars`. This takes O(n) time, where n is the length of the password string.

2. We also count the number of repeating characters in a row. For each repeating sequence of length 3 or more, we calculate the number of replacements needed to break the sequence. We store the count of sequences with length divisible by 3 in `oneReplace` and the count of sequences with length having a remainder of 1 when divided by 3 in `twoReplace`. This also takes O(n) time.

3. If the password length is less than 6, we return the maximum of `requiredChars` and the number of characters needed to reach the minimum length of 6.

4. If the password length is between 6 and 20 (inclusive), we return the maximum of `requiredChars` and the total number of replacements needed to break the repeating sequences.

5. If the password length is greater than 20, we need to delete characters to reduce the length to 20. We first try to delete characters from repeating sequences of length divisible by 3 (`oneReplace`), then from sequences with length having a remainder of 1 when divided by 3 (`twoReplace`), and finally from any remaining repeating sequences. This minimizes the number of additional replacements needed after deleting characters.

6. Finally, we return the sum of the number of characters deleted and the maximum of `requiredChars` and the remaining replacements needed.

The overall time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the password string. The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a constant amount of extra space.
