/*
Approach:
- We use dynamic programming to solve this problem.
- We create a DP array dp of size n + 1, where n is the length of the target string.
- dp[i] represents the minimum number of valid strings needed to form the prefix of target of length i.
- We initialize dp[0] as 0 since an empty string requires no valid strings.
- We iterate through each position i in the target string from 1 to n.
- For each position i, we check each word in the words array.
- If the current word is a valid prefix of the target string ending at position i, we update dp[i] if necessary.
- To update dp[i], we check if dp[i - len] (where len is the length of the current word) is not INT_MAX (meaning it's possible to form the prefix up to position i - len).
- If it's possible, we update dp[i] as the minimum of its current value and dp[i - len] + 1 (adding the current word to the minimum number of valid strings needed to form the prefix up to position i - len).
- After the iterations, we check the value of dp[n].
- If dp[n] is INT_MAX, it means it's not possible to form the target string using the given words, so we return -1.
- Otherwise, we return dp[n] as the minimum number of valid strings needed to form the target string.

Time Complexity: O(n * m * k), where n is the length of the target string, m is the number of words, and k is the average length of each word.
Space Complexity: O(n) to store the DP array.

The solution handles all the given constraints and edge cases. It is optimized for time and space complexity and follows best coding practices with clear comments explaining the approach and complexity analysis.
