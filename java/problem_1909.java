Here's a complete, well-commented Java solution for the LeetCode problem #1909 "Remove One Element to Make the Array Strictly Increasing":


class Solution {
    public boolean canBeIncreasing(int[] nums) {
        // Edge case: If the array has only 2 elements, it can always be made strictly increasing
        if (nums.length == 2) {
            return true;
        }
        
        // Count the number of elements that need to be removed
        int count = 0;
        
        // Iterate through the array starting from index 1
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            // If the current element is smaller than or equal to the previous element
            if (nums[i] <= nums[i - 1]) {
                // Increment the count of elements to be removed
                count++;
                
                // If more than one element needs to be removed, return false
                if (count > 1) {
                    return false;
                }
                
                // If the current index is greater than 1 and the current element is smaller than or equal to the element two positions back
                if (i > 1 && nums[i] <= nums[i - 2]) {
                    // Set the current element to the value of the previous element
                    nums[i] = nums[i - 1];
                }
            }
        }
        
        // If the count of elements to be removed is less than or equal to 1, return true; otherwise, return false
        return count <= 1;
    }
}


Approach and Complexity Analysis:
- The solution iterates through the array starting from index 1 and checks if each element is strictly greater than the previous element.
- If an element is found to be smaller than or equal to the previous element, it increments a count variable to keep track of the number of elements that need to be removed.
- If the count exceeds 1, it means more than one element needs to be removed, and the function returns false.
- If the current index is greater than 1 and the current element is smaller than or equal to the element two positions back, it means removing the previous element won't make the array strictly increasing. In this case, the current element is set to the value of the previous element to handle the case where the current element needs to be removed.
- Finally, the function returns true if the count of elements to be removed is less than or equal to 1; otherwise, it returns false.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input array nums. The solution iterates through the array once.
Space Complexity: O(1) as the solution uses only a constant amount of extra space.

The solution handles all edge cases, including:
- When the array has only 2 elements, it can always be made strictly increasing by removing one element if necessary.
- When more than one element needs to be removed, the function returns false.
- When removing the previous element doesn't make the array strictly increasing, the current element is updated to handle the case where the current element needs to be removed.

The solution follows best coding practices, including:
- Proper indentation and formatting for readability.
- Meaningful variable names.
- Comments explaining the approach and important steps.
