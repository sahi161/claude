Here's a complete, well-commented Java solution for the LeetCode problem #3321 "Find X-Sum of All K-Long Subarrays II":


class Solution {
    public long[] findXSum(int[] nums, int k, int x) {
        int n = nums.length;
        long[] answer = new long[n - k + 1];

        // Create a frequency map to count occurrences of elements
        Map<Integer, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            frequencyMap.put(nums[i], frequencyMap.getOrDefault(nums[i], 0) + 1);
        }

        // Calculate the x-sum for the first subarray
        answer[0] = calculateXSum(frequencyMap, x);

        // Slide the window and update the frequency map and x-sum for each subarray
        for (int i = k; i < n; i++) {
            // Remove the first element of the previous subarray from the frequency map
            frequencyMap.put(nums[i - k], frequencyMap.get(nums[i - k]) - 1);
            if (frequencyMap.get(nums[i - k]) == 0) {
                frequencyMap.remove(nums[i - k]);
            }

            // Add the new element to the frequency map
            frequencyMap.put(nums[i], frequencyMap.getOrDefault(nums[i], 0) + 1);

            // Calculate the x-sum for the current subarray
            answer[i - k + 1] = calculateXSum(frequencyMap, x);
        }

        return answer;
    }

    private long calculateXSum(Map<Integer, Integer> frequencyMap, int x) {
        // Create a list to store the elements and their frequencies
        List<int[]> frequencyList = new ArrayList<>();
        for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : frequencyMap.entrySet()) {
            frequencyList.add(new int[]{entry.getKey(), entry.getValue()});
        }

        // Sort the list based on frequency (descending) and element value (descending)
        Collections.sort(frequencyList, (a, b) -> {
            if (a[1] != b[1]) {
                return b[1] - a[1];
            }
            return b[0] - a[0];
        });

        // Calculate the x-sum by considering the top x most frequent elements
        long xSum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < Math.min(x, frequencyList.size()); i++) {
            xSum += (long) frequencyList.get(i)[0] * frequencyList.get(i)[1];
        }

        return xSum;
    }
}


Approach and Complexity Analysis:
- The solution uses the sliding window technique to calculate the x-sum for each subarray of length k.
- We maintain a frequency map to count the occurrences of elements in the current subarray.
- For each subarray, we calculate the x-sum by considering the top x most frequent elements.
- To determine the top x most frequent elements, we create a list of elements and their frequencies, sort it based on frequency (descending) and element value (descending), and consider the top x elements.
- The x-sum is calculated by multiplying each element with its frequency and summing up the results.
- Time Complexity: O(n * (k + x * log(x))), where n is the length of the input array, k is the subarray length, and x is the number of top frequent elements to consider.
  - We iterate over n - k + 1 subarrays.
  - For each subarray, updating the frequency map takes O(1) time.
  - Calculating the x-sum requires sorting the frequency list, which takes O(x * log(x)) time.
- Space Complexity: O(k), where k is the subarray length.
  - The frequency map and frequency list can store at most k distinct elements.
  - The output array has a length of n - k + 1.
