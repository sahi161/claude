Here's a complete, well-commented Java solution for the LeetCode problem #3288 "Length of the Longest Increasing Path":


import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int maxPathLength(int[][] coordinates, int k) {
        int n = coordinates.length;
        
        // Sort the coordinates array based on x-coordinate
        Arrays.sort(coordinates, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
        
        // Create an array to store the maximum path length ending at each coordinate
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(dp, 1);
        
        // Initialize the result with the path length ending at coordinates[k]
        int result = 1;
        
        // Iterate through the coordinates starting from index 1
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            // Check all previous coordinates for potential increasing paths
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                // If the current coordinate is greater than the previous coordinate
                if (coordinates[i][0] > coordinates[j][0] && coordinates[i][1] > coordinates[j][1]) {
                    // Update the maximum path length ending at the current coordinate
                    dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
                }
            }
            
            // Update the result if the current coordinate is coordinates[k]
            if (i == k) {
                result = dp[i];
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}


Approach and Complexity Analysis:
1. We start by sorting the `coordinates` array based on the x-coordinate in ascending order. This allows us to process the coordinates in a way that ensures we only consider previous coordinates with smaller x-coordinates.
   - Time Complexity: O(n log n), where n is the number of coordinates.
   - Space Complexity: O(log n) for the sorting operation.

2. We create an array `dp` of size n to store the maximum path length ending at each coordinate. Initially, all elements in `dp` are set to 1 since every coordinate is a valid increasing path of length 1.
   - Time Complexity: O(n)
   - Space Complexity: O(n)

3. We initialize the `result` variable with the path length ending at `coordinates[k]`, which is initially 1.

4. We iterate through the coordinates starting from index 1. For each coordinate, we check all previous coordinates to see if they form an increasing path with the current coordinate.
   - If the current coordinate is greater than a previous coordinate in both x and y dimensions, we update the maximum path length ending at the current coordinate by taking the maximum of the current value and the path length ending at the previous coordinate plus 1.
   - If the current coordinate is `coordinates[k]`, we update the `result` with the maximum path length ending at `coordinates[k]`.
   - Time Complexity: O(n^2), where n is the number of coordinates.

5. Finally, we return the `result`, which represents the maximum length of an increasing path that contains `coordinates[k]`.

Overall:
- Time Complexity: O(n^2), where n is the number of coordinates.
- Space Complexity: O(n) for the `dp` array and the sorting operation.
