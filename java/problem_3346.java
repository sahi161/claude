Here's a complete, well-commented Java solution for the LeetCode problem #3346 - Maximum Frequency of an Element After Performing Operations I:


class Solution {
    public int maxFrequency(int[] nums, int k, int numOperations) {
        // Sort the array in ascending order
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        
        int n = nums.length;
        int maxFreq = 1; // Initialize the maximum frequency to 1
        
        // Create a prefix sum array to store the cumulative sum of elements
        long[] prefixSum = new long[n + 1];
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            prefixSum[i] = prefixSum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1];
        }
        
        // Perform binary search to find the maximum frequency
        int left = 1, right = n;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            
            // Check if it's possible to achieve a frequency of mid
            if (canAchieveFrequency(nums, prefixSum, k, numOperations, mid)) {
                maxFreq = mid;
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        return maxFreq;
    }
    
    private boolean canAchieveFrequency(int[] nums, long[] prefixSum, int k, int numOperations, int freq) {
        int n = nums.length;
        
        // Iterate through the array and check if it's possible to achieve the frequency
        for (int i = freq - 1; i < n; i++) {
            long sum = prefixSum[i + 1] - prefixSum[i - freq + 1];
            long target = (long) nums[i] * freq;
            
            // Check if the difference between the target sum and the actual sum can be covered by the available operations
            if (target - sum <= (long) k * numOperations) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
}


Approach and Complexity Analysis:
1. We start by sorting the array in ascending order. This allows us to efficiently calculate the sum of elements in a subarray using prefix sum.
2. We initialize the maximum frequency to 1 since any element can have a frequency of at least 1.
3. We create a prefix sum array to store the cumulative sum of elements. This helps us calculate the sum of elements in a subarray in constant time.
4. We perform a binary search on the range [1, n] to find the maximum frequency. The binary search helps us efficiently search for the highest possible frequency.
5. In each iteration of the binary search, we check if it's possible to achieve a frequency of mid using the `canAchieveFrequency` function.
6. The `canAchieveFrequency` function iterates through the array and checks if it's possible to achieve the given frequency for each subarray of length freq.
7. For each subarray, we calculate the sum of elements using the prefix sum array and compare it with the target sum (nums[i] * freq).
8. If the difference between the target sum and the actual sum can be covered by the available operations (k * numOperations), we return true, indicating that the frequency is achievable.
9. If we find a frequency that is achievable, we update the maximum frequency and continue the binary search on the right half. Otherwise, we search on the left half.
10. Finally, we return the maximum frequency achieved.

Time Complexity: O(n log n), where n is the length of the nums array. The sorting step takes O(n log n) time, and the binary search takes O(log n) iterations. In each iteration, the `canAchieveFrequency` function takes O(n) time. Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n log n).

Space Complexity: O(n) to store the prefix sum array.
